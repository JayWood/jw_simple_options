Thank you for taking time to download, or at least consider downloading, my Options Framework.  This framework was designed out of a necessity for my clients and I.  Furthermore, I determined to write my own when I was unhappy in how others worked.  Not to mention the fact that it's better to write it yourself so you know your code, rather than to try and decipher another individuals coding methods.

> Documentation is lacking at this point.

### Documentation
The code itself has been documented to the best of my ability within the necessary files.  However, my attempt at following PHP documentation standards may be less than some would come to expect, although I'm pretty sure most of you can understand the inline documentation.  An example configuration file should be enough to get you started, however, not all config options are enabled.  View the course of the simple_options.php for more neat little functions.

### Support
Support for this framework is only provided on GitHub.
